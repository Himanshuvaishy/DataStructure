In Java, data types define the type of data a variable can hold. They tell the compiler how much memory to allocate for that variable and what kind of operations can be performed on it.

Categories of Data Types in Java

Primitive Data Types
Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
1. Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types are the most basic data types available in Java. There are 8 primitive data types:

Data Type	Size	Default Value	Description
byte	1 byte (8 bits)	0	Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127.
short	2 bytes (16 bits)	0	Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767.
int	4 bytes (32 bits)	0	Stores whole numbers from -2^31 to 2^31-1.
long	8 bytes (64 bits)	0L	Stores whole numbers from -2^63 to 2^63-1.
float	4 bytes (32 bits)	0.0f	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits.
double	8 bytes (64 bits)	0.0d	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits.
char	2 bytes (16 bits)	\u0000	Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values.
boolean	1 bit	false	Stores true or false values.
2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
Non-primitive data types are more complex types and include objects, arrays, and classes. Unlike primitive types, they can hold references to memory locations where data is stored.

String: A sequence of characters. Example: "Hello, World!"
Array: A collection of elements of the same type. Example: int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
Class: A blueprint for creating objects. Example: MyClass obj = new MyClass();
Interface: A reference type used to specify what methods a class must implement.
Differences Between Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types
Memory Usage: Primitive types use fixed memory, while non-primitive types use variable memory depending on the object size.
Default Values: Primitive types have default values (e.g., 0 for numbers, false for boolean), while non-primitive types default to null.
Methods: Non-primitive types can call methods (e.g., String.length()), while primitive types cannot.
Examples
Primitive Data Types:

java
Copy code
int age = 25;        // Integer
double price = 19.99; // Double-precision floating-point
char grade = 'A';    // Character
boolean isJavaFun = true; // Boolean
Non-Primitive Data Types:

java
Copy code
String name = "Alice"; // String object
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3}; // Array of integers
MyClass obj = new MyClass(); // Object of a class
Summary
Primitive Data Types: Basic types like int, char, boolean, etc., with fixed sizes.
Non-Primitive Data Types: More complex types like Strings, Arrays, and Objects that can hold more data and methods.
